## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital age, video games have become a dominant form of entertainment. However, this has led to increased sedentary behavior among young adults, resulting in various health issues. **Aller! USTH** addresses this problem by merging physical activity with engaging gameplay, utilizing pose estimation models to ensure accurate and responsive movement tracking.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Pose Estimation**: Utilizes the laptop or PC webcam to capture and analyze players' movements using MediaPipe Pose and MoveNet models.
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Includes endless-running, object-slicing, and shape-fitting modes, each requiring distinct physical actions.
- **Accurate Tracking**: Employs advanced landmark detection to ensure precise and responsive gameplay.
- **Accessible Hardware**: Designed to work with standard webcams, eliminating the need for specialized equipment.
- **Health-focused Design**: Encourages physical activity, making it an integral part of the gaming experience.

## Technology Stack

### Pose Estimation Models

- **MediaPipe Pose**: Developed by Google, provides high accuracy and real-time performance, detecting 33 key body landmarks.
- **MoveNet**: A fast and precise model designed for real-time applications, capable of detecting 17 key body landmarks with minimal latency.

### Game Design

- **Unity**: Chosen for its robust features and beginner-friendly interface, Unity supports complex game mechanics and seamless integration with pose estimation models.
- **Blender**: Used for creating detailed 3D models and animations, ensuring high-quality visual elements within the game.
