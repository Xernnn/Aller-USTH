# Aller! USTH - USTH's Internship / Graduation Project

(For more information of the project, please refer to the [final report](Thesis.pdf).)

**Aller! USTH** is a physical enhancement gaming application developed to merge fitness with gameplay, using advanced pose estimation technology. This project aims to combat sedentary behavior among students and young adults by encouraging regular physical activity through engaging and interactive gameplay.

## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital age, video games have become a dominant form of entertainment. However, this has led to increased sedentary behavior among young adults, resulting in various health issues. **Aller! USTH** addresses this problem by merging physical activity with engaging gameplay, utilizing pose estimation models to ensure accurate and responsive movement tracking.
